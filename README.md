Hi Felipe, Marc, Audrey, and team,

I hope this finds you all well! First off, I really appreciate that you all gave me the choice of using Express! Definitely made the whole process easier for me.
You'll find documentation written in the comments at the top of each file as well as in relevant areas in the code.
I had a lot of fun building the backend of this app! Hopefully you all have as much fun reading through the code as I had writing it.

All the best,
Chris
